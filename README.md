Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent various preprocessing steps, including:

Tokenization
Converting text to lowercase
Removing punctuation
Removing stopwords
The preprocess_text function in preprocessing.py handles these steps.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to gain insights into the data and understand its distribution, relationships, and patterns. Visualizations such as histograms, word clouds, and bar charts were used for analysis.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involved transforming the text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization. This step is crucial for feeding the data into machine learning models.

Model Building
Several machine learning models were considered for fake news detection, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Each model was trained, evaluated, and compared based on their performance metrics.

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
The evaluate_model_with_mse function in evaluation.py calculates these metrics.

Results
The evaluation results showed that the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model outperformed other models in detecting fake news, achieving the highest accuracy and the lowest MSE.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques for fake news detection. The GRU model proved to be the most effective in predicting the authenticity of news articles, providing valuable insights for combating misinformation.
